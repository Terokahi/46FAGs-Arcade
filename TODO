caveins happen randomly, cealing next to wall has chance of 0,01 and one ex.:100 Tiles away has 100 chance to cavein
procedural generated Mineshafts, Forest, Caverns

Special Rooms
     Special rooms can always spawn
     if it's the right biome higher spawn chance
          eg.: Abandoned Fortress primarily in cavern but can spawn in simple caves

add entitys 
     keep knowledge even on sickness and injury, even if stats are too low to use it
     Entitys need food, drink, sleep for basic survival
     Entitys can share survival skills with others (random chance)
     Animals might randomly fall down holes from the surface and survive

add Crafting
     (implement later)
     Race dependendency
     Talent dependency

add different Biomes
     cavern
     floating island caverns  
     cave
     abandoned city
     forests (Ffaeble has something planned)

Different Races different versions of government
     Tech tree
          (implement later)
          Race Dependency
          entity Dependency (Unit dies technology lost)
          
     different Units
          early Smart orcs get abused by others
               (not able to turn into shaman)
          
          theoretical knowledge get's turned into practical knowledge
               A mage can't immediately cast fireball after learning it, but mistakes might lead to new knowledge

          to upgrade melee units weapon wielding lvl. and footwork lvl. must be appropriate
          
          different units need different stats, a entity needs to know strategy to be turned into a marshall

     civil wars
          not enough food
          not enough religious worship
          not enough enjoyment
          too many slums.
          Race acceptance too low     
     
     different Races different do's and can'ts eg.:
          Dwarves good with runes, can't use magic
          Elves good with magic can't eat or prepare meat, low str?

different Gods like different buildings and behaviour
     Gods get story and lore
     entitys and units can be called upon by a god or used as a vessel
          depending on god good or bad
